# Publishing to GitHub - Checklist

This document contains the steps to publish this repository to GitHub.

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

- [x] Created `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files (.env, logs/, cache)
- [x] Created `LICENSE` file (MIT)
- [x] Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines
- [x] Enhanced `README.md` with badges and GitHub-specific sections
- [x] Created `.env.example` as template (with PORT=auto)
- [x] Initialized git repository
- [x] Made initial commit (13 files, 555 lines)

## üìã Next Steps to Publish

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository:

- **Name**: `sim7600-tutorial` (lowercase with hyphens for better discoverability)
- **Description**: "Tutorial for SIM7600: SMS, GPS, and Voice on Windows"
- **Visibility**: Public
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Add Remote and Push

After creating the GitHub repo, run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sim7600-tutorial.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Update README.md

After pushing, update the README.md links:

- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in the issues link (line 82)
- Commit and push: `git commit -am "Update GitHub username" && git push`

### 4. Configure GitHub Repository Settings

In your GitHub repository settings:

#### About Section

- Add description: "Tutorial for SIM7600G-H modem: SMS logger with auto-detection"
- Add topics: `sim7600g-h`, `sms`, `sim7600`, `python`, `serial-communication`, `at-commands`, `gsm-modem`, `windows`, `tutorial`

#### Optional: Set up GitHub Actions

Consider adding CI/CD for:

- Linting (ruff, pylint, mypy)
- Code formatting checks (black)
- Testing (if you add tests in the future)

#### Optional: Add Issue Templates

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` with templates for:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests

### 5. Verify Everything

Before announcing your project:

- [ ] Verify .env is NOT in the repository: `git log --all --full-history -- .env`
      (Should show: "fatal: ambiguous argument '.env': unknown revision")
- [ ] Verify logs/ is NOT in the repository: `git log --all --full-history -- logs/`
      (Should show: "fatal: ambiguous argument 'logs/': unknown revision")
- [ ] Test the installation instructions from README.md in a fresh environment
- [ ] Check all links in README.md work correctly

## üîí Security Reminders

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit `.env` - it contains configuration that may be sensitive
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit `logs/` - it contains phone numbers and SMS messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Before committing new files, always check with `git status` first
- If you accidentally commit sensitive data, see: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository

## üì¢ After Publishing

Consider:

1. Adding a screenshot or demo video to README.md
2. Announcing on relevant forums/communities
3. Adding more comprehensive documentation
4. Creating a changelog (CHANGELOG.md)
5. Setting up GitHub Releases for version tags

## ü§ù Maintenance

- Respond to issues and pull requests
- Keep dependencies updated
- Add tests for better reliability
- Consider adding a code of conduct
