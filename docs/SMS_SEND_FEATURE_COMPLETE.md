# ✅ SMS Send Feature - Implementation Complete!

## 🎉 Status: Production Ready

The SMS send feature is **fully implemented, tested, and documented** with smart character handling.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Send ASCII Message (No Prompt)

```powershell
python -m sim7600 sms send "+1234567890" "Hello World!"
# ✅ Sends immediately
```

### Send with Special Characters (Shows Confirmation)

```powershell
python -m sim7600 sms send "+1234567890" "café 🎉"
```

**Shows warning:**

```
⚠️  WARNING: Your message contains special characters (accents, emoji, etc.)
The SIM7600 modem has limited support for these characters.
Your message may appear corrupted or garbled on the recipient's phone.

Original message: café 🎉
May be sent as:     cafe ?

Do you want to continue anyway? (y/N):
```

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Core Features

1. **SMS Sending** - Full AT command implementation
2. **Auto-detection** - Finds SIM7600 modem automatically
3. **User Confirmation** - Warns about special character conversions
4. **Character Preview** - Shows what will actually be sent
5. **Unicode Normalization** - Properly handles accented characters
6. **Debug Mode** - `--echo` flag for troubleshooting

### User Experience

- ✅ ASCII messages send instantly without prompts
- ⚠️ Special characters trigger confirmation with preview

### Files Modified

1. **`src/sim7600/modem.py`**

   - Added `send_sms()` method
   - Implemented Unicode normalization (NFD)
   - Character transliteration logic
   - Proper AT command sequence

2. **`src/sim7600/__main__.py`**

   - Added confirmation prompt for special characters
   - Preview generation before sending
   - User input handling
   - Graceful cancellation

3. **`src/sim7600/__init__.py`**
   - Exported `Modem` class for library use

### Dependencies

- ✅ No new dependencies required
- ✅ Uses built-in `unicodedata` module
- ✅ Works with existing `pyserial`

---

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Command Line

```powershell
# Basic send
python -m sim7600 sms send "+1234567890" "Hello!"

# With debug mode
python -m sim7600 sms send "+1234567890" "Test" --echo

# Specific port
python -m sim7600 sms send "+1234567890" "Test" --port COM10
```

### Python Library

```python
from sim7600 import Modem, find_sim7600_port

# Setup
port = find_sim7600_port()
modem = Modem(port)
modem.open()

# Send (no prompts in library mode)
success = modem.send_sms("+1234567890", "Hello!")

if success:
    print("✅ Message sent!")
else:
    print("❌ Failed to send")

# Close
modem.close()
```

## 🎯 Design Decisions

### Why User Confirmation?

**Problem:** SIM7600 doesn't support full Unicode in text mode.

**Considered Options:**

1. ❌ Silently convert - User wouldn't know message changed
2. ❌ Reject special chars - Too restrictive
3. ❌ PDU mode - Too complex to implement
4. ✅ **Show warning + preview** - Best balance

**Benefits:**

- Transparent - user knows what will be sent
- User choice - proceed or cancel
- Simple - no complex encoding
- Reliable - works consistently

### Why Unicode Normalization?

**Converts:** `café` → `cafe` (keeps meaning)  
**Not:** `café` → `caf` (loses information)

Using NFD (Canonical Decomposition):

- Decomposes: `é` → `e` + combining accent
- Strips accents, keeps base letters
- Result is readable and meaningful

## 📖 Command Reference

### All Options

```powershell
python -m sim7600 sms send <phone> <message> [options]

Options:
  --port PORT         Serial port (default: auto-detect)
  --baud RATE        Baud rate (default: 115200)
  --encoding TYPE    Informational only (always uses GSM)
  --echo             Show raw modem communication
```

### Examples

```powershell
# Auto-detect modem
python -m sim7600 sms send "+123" "Test"

# Specific port
python -m sim7600 sms send "+123" "Test" --port COM10

# Debug mode
python -m sim7600 sms send "+123" "Test" --echo
```
