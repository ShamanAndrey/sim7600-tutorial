# Project Overview: What Is This?

## 🎯 **The Purpose (In Simple Terms)**

This project is a **tutorial and toolkit** for people who bought a **SIM7600G-H 4G modem** and want to:

1. **Receive SMS messages** on their computer
2. **Learn how GSM/LTE modems work**
3. **Build SMS-based projects** (notifications, IoT, automation)

Think of it as a **bridge between your computer and your modem** that makes working with SMS super easy.

## 🤔 The Problem It Solves

### Without This Project:

- You buy a SIM7600G-H modem
- You plug it in via USB
- You have NO idea how to use it!
- You need to:
  - Figure out which COM port it's on
  - Learn AT commands (cryptic modem language)
  - Write serial communication code
  - Parse incoming SMS format
  - Handle errors and edge cases

### With This Project:

```powershell
python -m sim7600 sms receive
```

Done! It automatically:

- Finds your modem
- Connects to it
- Receives and logs SMS messages
- Shows them on screen in real-time

## 🏗️ What It Does (Technically)

### Core Functionality:

1. **Auto-Detection**

   - Scans all USB COM ports
   - Identifies the SIM7600G-H modem
   - Connects to the correct "AT PORT"

2. **SMS Receiving**

   - Sends AT commands to modem (`AT+CMGF=1`, `AT+CNMI=2,2,0,0,0`)
   - Switches modem to "push mode" (SMS come automatically)
   - Listens for incoming `+CMT:` messages
   - Parses sender, timestamp, and message text

3. **Logging**
   - Saves to text file: `logs/sms.log`
   - Optionally saves to JSON: `logs/sms.jsonl`
   - Shows on screen in real-time
   - Rotating log files (doesn't fill your disk)

## 📚 The Architecture (How It Works)

### The Flow:

                  |                           |                           |
                  v                           v                           v
            Console Output              logs/sms.log              logs/sms.jsonl
         (shows on screen)             (text file)              (JSON format)
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts You Should Know

### 1. **Serial Communication**

- Your modem appears as a "COM port" (COM10, COM8, etc.)
- Python uses `pyserial` library to talk to it
- It's like a very basic text chat with the modem

### 2. **AT Commands**

- Language that modems understand
- Examples:
  - `AT` → "Are you there?" (modem replies "OK")
  - `AT+CMGF=1` → "Use text mode for SMS"
  - `AT+CNMI=2,2,0,0,0` → "Push SMS to me immediately"

### 3. **+CMT Format**

When an SMS arrives, modem sends:

```
+CMT: "+1234567890","","25/10/18,14:30:00+00"
Hello, this is the message text!
```

Your program parses this into:

```python
{
    "sender": "+1234567890",
    "timestamp": "25/10/18,14:30:00+00",
    "text": "Hello, this is the message text!"
}
```

### 4. **The SIM7600 Creates Multiple Ports**

When you plug it in, Windows creates 5 COM ports:

- COM8: NMEA (GPS data)
- **COM10: AT PORT** ← **This is what we need!**
- COM11: Audio
- COM12: Diagnostics
- COM9: Modem

Your program automatically picks the right one.

## 🎓 Key Takeaway

This project is a **bridge between hardware and software**. It takes something complex (cellular modem communication) and makes it simple (one Python command). The architecture is clean enough to learn from, yet powerful enough to build real projects on.

It's both a **tutorial** (teaching you how modems work) and a **toolkit** (giving you reusable code) for SMS projects.
