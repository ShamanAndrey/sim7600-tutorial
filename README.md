**Just got your SIM7600G-H modem and want to play with it?** This project lets you receive and log SMS messages automatically on your Windows computer! üöÄ

Perfect for:

- üì± Testing your new SIM7600G-H modem
- üß™ Learning about GSM/LTE modems and AT commands
- üîî Building SMS notification systems
- üìä Logging messages for analysis
- üéì Educational projects and experimenting

> üí° **Beginner-friendly!** No prior experience needed. Just follow the steps below.

> ü™ü **Windows only** - This guide is for Windows 10/11. Linux users can adapt with minor changes.

personal note this project was mostly created using AI and I'm using SIM7600g-H 4G HAT (b) for the development of this repository. If you find any issues with your setup please raise and issue.

## üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. **SIM7600G-H Modem** (or compatible SIMCom modem)

   - USB cable to connect to your computer
   - Active SIM card inserted into the modem
   - Antenna connected (important for signal!)

2. **Windows Computer** (Windows 10 or 11)
3. **Python 3.10 or newer**
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"!

That's it! Everything else will be installed automatically.

## ‚ú® What This Does

- **Automatically finds your modem** - no manual port configuration!
- **Receives SMS in real-time** - messages appear as they arrive
- **Logs everything** - saves to text files and optional JSON format
- **Shows messages on screen** - see incoming SMS instantly
- **Easy to use** - just run one command!

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Connect Your Modem

1. Insert your SIM card into the SIM7600G-H modem
2. Connect the antenna (üì° Important for getting signal!)
3. Plug the USB cable into your computer
4. Wait for Windows to install drivers (this happens automatically)
5. Check Device Manager - you should see several "Simcom HS-USB" ports

### Step 2: Install Python

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.10 or newer
3. Run the installer
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Check the box "Add Python to PATH"
5. Click "Install Now"

### Step 3: Download This Project

Open **PowerShell** (search for it in Windows Start menu) and run:

```powershell
cd Downloads
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sim7600-tutorial.git
cd sim7600-tutorial
```

> **Don't have Git?** Download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it, then `cd` to that folder.

### Step 4: Install the Program

In PowerShell, run these commands:

```powershell
# Create a virtual environment (keeps things clean)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install the program
pip install -e .
```

> üí° You should see `(.venv)` at the start of your PowerShell prompt now.

### Step 5: Test Your Modem

Let's check if everything works:

```powershell
python -m sim7600 sms receive --init-only
```

You should see:

```
[INFO] Auto-detecting SIM7600 modem...
[INFO] Found SIM7600 modem on COM10
[INFO] Modem initialized for SMS push (+CMT).
[INFO] Init-only requested; exiting.
```

üéâ **Success!** Your modem is ready!

### Step 6: Start Receiving SMS

Now run the program without the `--init-only` flag:

```powershell
python -m sim7600 sms receive
```

**That's it!** The program is now running and waiting for SMS messages. Send a text to your SIM card's number and watch it appear on screen! üì±‚ú®

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the program.

> üí° **Note:** Currently only SMS receiving is implemented. GPS and voice features coming soon!

## üéÆ What Can You Do Now?

### View Your Received Messages

All messages are saved to:

- `logs/sms.log` - Easy to read text format
- `logs/sms.jsonl` - JSON format for programming

Open them with Notepad or any text editor!

### Run in Background

Want it to run 24/7? Use:

```powershell
python -m sim7600 sms receive --no-console
```

### Save to JSON

Track messages in JSON format:

```powershell
python -m sim7600 sms receive --json-out logs/messages.jsonl
```

### Custom Configuration

Create a `.env` file for persistent settings:

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
notepad .env
```

Edit values like:

- `PORT=auto` (or specific port like COM10)
- `LOG_PATH=logs/sms.log`
- `JSONL_PATH=logs/sms.jsonl`

### Future Features (Coming Soon!)

```powershell
# SMS (current)
python -m sim7600 sms receive          # ‚úÖ Working now
python -m sim7600 sms send "+123:Hi"   # üöß Coming soon

# GPS (planned)
python -m sim7600 gps track            # üöß Coming soon

# Voice (planned)
python -m sim7600 voice dial "+123"    # üöß Coming soon
```

## üìù Command Options

### Basic Usage

```powershell
python -m sim7600 sms receive              # Start receiving SMS (most common)
python -m sim7600 sms receive --init-only  # Just test the connection
python -m sim7600 sms --help               # Show all SMS options
```

### All Available Options

| Option         | What it does                                | Example                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `--port`       | Specify COM port (auto-detected by default) | `--port COM10`              |
| `--logfile`    | Where to save messages                      | `--logfile my_sms.log`      |
| `--json-out`   | Save as JSON too                            | `--json-out messages.jsonl` |
| `--no-console` | Don't show messages on screen (silent mode) | `--no-console`              |
| `--init-only`  | Test connection and exit                    | `--init-only`               |
| `--echo`       | Show raw modem responses (for debugging)    | `--echo`                    |

### Examples

```powershell
# Basic - just receive and log SMS
python -m sim7600 sms receive

# Silent mode - runs in background without showing messages
python -m sim7600 sms receive --no-console

# Custom log location
python -m sim7600 sms receive --logfile C:\MyLogs\sms.log

# Save to both text and JSON
python -m sim7600 sms receive --json-out messages.jsonl

# Force a specific COM port
python -m sim7600 sms receive --port COM10
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Could not find SIM7600 modem"

**Check these:**

1. Is the modem plugged in via USB?
2. Open Device Manager (search in Start menu)
3. Look for "Ports (COM & LPT)"
4. You should see multiple "Simcom HS-USB" devices
5. One should say "AT PORT" - that's what we need!

**If you don't see any Simcom devices:**

- Unplug and replug the USB cable
- Try a different USB port
- Check if Windows is installing drivers (bottom-right notification area)
- Restart your computer

### "Port COM10 is already in use"

Someone else is using the COM port! Try this:

```powershell
# Find what's using the port
Get-Process python* | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*python*"}

# Kill it (replace 12345 with the actual Process ID)
Stop-Process -Id 12345 -Force
```

Or just:

- Close any serial terminal programs (TeraTerm, PuTTY, Arduino IDE)
- Restart your computer (easiest!)

### "Python is not recognized"

You forgot to add Python to PATH during installation!

**Fix:**

1. Uninstall Python (Windows Settings ‚Üí Apps)
2. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) again
3. Run installer
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **CHECK "Add Python to PATH"**
5. Install

### "Not receiving any SMS"

**Check your modem status:**

```powershell
# Test connection
python -m sim7600 sms receive --init-only
```

**Check signal strength:**

- Make sure the antenna is connected
- The modem should have a blinking LED
- Try moving to a window or outside

**Check SIM card:**

- Is it inserted correctly?
- Is it activated by your carrier?
- Can you send SMS to this number from another phone?

### "Permission denied" or ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded"

PowerShell security settings are blocking the script.

**Fix:**

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then try activating the virtual environment again.

### Still having issues?

1. **Check Device Manager**: You should see "Simcom HS-USB AT PORT 9001 (COM10)" or similar
2. **Multiple ports?**: The SIM7600 creates 5 different COM ports - the program auto-selects the right one (AT PORT)
3. **Manual port**: If auto-detection fails, manually specify: `python -m sim7600 sms receive --port COM10`
4. **Enable debug mode**: Run with `--echo` to see raw modem communication
5. **Open an issue**: [Report a bug on GitHub](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sim7600-tutorial/issues)
